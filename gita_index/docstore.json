The Bhagad Gita is just a small part of the epic Mahabharat. Now-a-days this \nsacred Bhagavad Gita (\u201cSong of the Lord, Srikrishna\u201d ) is among the most important religious \ntexts of Hinduism and easily the best known to all. It has been quoted by writers, poets, \nscientists, theologians, and philosophers among others for centuries and is often the introductory \ntext to Hinduism for a Western audience. It is a divine book written in Sanskrit language which \nis spoken by Lord Krishna for the troubled humanity and it provides many solutions to our day to \nday life problems which help us to balance our temporal needs and worldly concerns with our \nspiritual goals. It often being described as a concise guide to Hindu theology and also has a \npractical, self concentrate guide to life of all human beings. This Book gives us the unique way \nof life that eases off our tension and we enjoy a happy life. The Gita, apart from being a religious \nscripture, is a scripture of life as well as a way of life based on faith and devotion.  \n \nKeywords- \nBhagavad Gita, Upanishad, Faith, Devotion, Life, Soul, Dharma, Action, Meditation, Yoga, Self \nRealization, Liberation, Vedanta, etc.  \n \nIntroduction: \nThis divine book will add to self-reflection, better feeling and extend one's internal procedure. At \nthat point life on the planet can turn into a genuine training dynamic, full and cheerful regardless \nof what the condition. May the intelligence of adoring awareness ever direct us on our \nexcursion ? What makes the Holy Gita a down to earth brain research of change is that it offers us \nthe instruments to interface with our most profound elusive pith and we should figure out how to \ntake an interest in the skirmish of existence with the right information ? The Holy Gita is the pith \nof the Vedas, Upanishads. It is an all-inclusive sacred text pertinent to individuals of all \ndispositions and for all circumstances. It is a book with glorious considerations and reasonable \ndirections on Yoga, Devotion, Vedanta, and Action. It is significant in thought and glorious in \nstatures of vision. \nPurpose of the Research Paper: \nThere is a common misconception among many people that Bhagavad Gita and Mahabharata \nbelong to only those practicing the Hindu religion. The messages contained in the Bhagavad Gita \nare universally applicable to all, irrespective of their country or religion. It is not a religious \nscripture pertaining to a certain section of society. Bhagavad Gita teaches us the right way to \nlead our life.

Every man is in difficulty in so many ways, as Arjuna was in, having to fight the \nBattle of Kurukshetra.Bhagavad Gita is the essence of all Vedic knowledge and one of the most \nimportant Upanishads in Vedic literature. If one reads Bhagavad Gita regularly and attentively, \nhe can surpass the study of all Vedic literature. \nDefinition of life in Bhagavad Gita: \nIn Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna said that everything in our life happens for a cause or good \nreason. Whatever happens in life happen for good and there is always a cause or reason behind \nthat. He also mentioned that we all are children of God, the one creator. God is supreme power \nand this world is governed by him. In the words of Lord Srikrishna- Every human in his life must \nabandon all varieties of religions and just surrender to Supreme Soul. He will deliver the man \nfrom all sinful reactions.  \nWords of the Bhagavad Gita for Awakening Human Life: \nA lot of moral words have been described in the Bhagavad Gita for Awakening Human Life. \nSome of them are as given below- \n\u201cHe who imagines this [the embodied Self] the slayer and he who imagines this [the embodied \nSelf] the slain, neither of them understands. This [the embodied Self] does not slay, nor is it \nslain\u201d (Ch 2/19). \nThe immortal part of us, the Atman, the pure spirit (consciousness) ever looks on at the \nexperiences of the lower self\u2013the mind, ego, subtle and gross bodies\u2013all that go to make up our \nrelative \u201cself.\u201d But so convincing is the drama, so compelling and literally engrossing, that it \nloses itself in the spectacle and thinks it is born, lives, and dies over and over, feeling the pain \nand pleasure that are nothing more than impulses in the field of energy that is the mind. \nThese are the vrittis in the chitta spoken of by Patanjali at the beginning of the Yoga Sutras, \nthe permanent cessation or prevention of which is Yoga. Through meditation we come to \nseparate ourselves from the movie screen of illusion. \nLearning is the purpose of the movie, so we do not just throw the switch and leave the theater. \nRather, we watch and figure out the meaning of everything. When we have learned the lessons, \nthe movie will stop of itself. Yoga is the means of learning. \n\u201cIn whatever way men approach Me, I reward them. Men everywhere follow my path\u201d (Ch \n4/11). \nFor us raised in the \u201clight that is darkness\u201d of Western religion, every verse of the Gita is a \nrevelation of stunning proportions. Certainly this is one of the most revelatory of them all\u2013it \nopens vistas that free and expand the heart as we never dreamed possible. Let us look at them \nand rejoice in them.

Success and failure are only symptoms of wisdom or folly. \nHe astutely evaluates the root of his consciousness, seeing his actions as the branches and leaves \nof that root. His work is with the root\u2013the rest will follow suit when the right quality has been \nattained. Effects have value only as indicators of the nature of the cause. He knows this, and is \nintent only on the rectification of the cause\u2013his state of awareness. \nSome Valuable Themes of Human Life in Bhagavad Gita:  \nActually the sacred Bhagavad Gita is entirely full of valuable themes which are always important \nfor a complete human life. Some of them are such as- \n1. Dharma (Sacred Duty): \nEach and every one of us is born with this \u201csacred duty\u201d that we must fulfill during this lifetime. \nFor Arjuna, it was the duty of being a warrior at the time of war. But for us, it may be the duty of \nbeing a good mom, daughter, or friend. \nSacred duty refers to the moral order that sustains the cosmos, society, and the individual. We \ncan all use this idea to help us cope with our responsibilities in life and see them not as burdens, \nbut as our sacred duties.  \n\u201cLook to your own duty; do not tremble before it . . . your own duty done imperfectly is better than another \nman\u2019s done well.\u201d \n  \nWhen we see things in this light, they can inspire us to fulfill our responsibilities with honor and \nto stop asking the question: Why me? \nFor example, why am I stuck with the burden of taking care of this person? Instead, don\u2019t \nquestion it. See it as your sacred duty in life, as a necessary sacrifice, and a spiritual obligation. If \nwe can transform the way we think and see life through this concept, we can lead more \nmeaningful lives.

Disciplined Action: \nIn this book, yoga is defined as discipline. It is the path of disciplined action. In the epic scene, \nArjuna (the warrior) stops in the middle of a battlefield, forfeiting his sacred duty. Then Krishna \ncomes along and demands him to take action. \nWe can all relate to Arjuna in this story. In difficult times we stop, paralyzed with fear and \ndoubt. The lesson here is to never stop turning the wheel set in motion because, when we do, we \nwaste our lives and bring our growth to a standstill.  \n\u201cThe disciplined man attains perfect peace; the undisciplined man is in bondage.\u201d \n  \nNow let\u2019s take this to our yoga mats. We\u2019re having a bad day, and we\u2019ve stuffed our faces with \njunk food and now we don\u2019t want to go to yoga class. Krishna tells us that it is only through \ndisciplined action that we can grow. We must conjure up all our discipline and get our asses to \nclass! \nThe Bhagavad Gita  severs the misconception that yoga is a spiritual hoo-ha where our heads are \nstuck in the clouds. Rather, it reveals that we must remain grounded and disciplined in our daily \nlives.This is why yoga is referred to as the disciplined path because it\u2019s not about lighting up \nincense and eating organic food. It\u2019s about being disciplined in everything we set out to do \n(whatever that looks like for you). \n \n3. Self-Knowledge : \nKrishna speaks a lot about self-mastery and that without it we are like \u201can enemy at war.\u201d \nWhy do we all practice yoga? \nFor many it is to be in shape and that\u2019s okay. But the spiritual purpose of a physical practice is so \nthe spine is strong enough to maintain healthy alignment in meditation for numerous hours (let \nthat sink in). So yoga is really the journey to self-realization.  \n\u201cSo sever the ignorant doubt in your heart with the sword of self-knowledge, Arjuna! Observe your discipline \narise!\u201d  \nEverything in life is fleeting right? The Bhagavad Gita  says no. There is one thing that is \nunchanging and that is the Self (our true essence). That is why the answers do not lie in the \nexternal world. They lie within us. \nLord Krishna tells us that we must part the clouds of ignorance with self-knowledge. Our \nknowledge is obscured by our desires. We think material things and the titles we hold can sustain \nus, but in truth, they are all fleeting. Krishna asks Arjuna to look inside himself to not be \nattached to the consequences, but to fight this war because it is his duty on this earth. \n \n4.

Lacking self-confidence, you may fear and suspect that you are \nweak or incompetent and thereby hesitate to speak or act with assertiveness, missing out on \npotential opportunities for growth or success. You may sabotage and hold yourself back in \nyour work, relationships, or personal life. As anyone who has slipped into ruts of self-doubt \nand insecurity can tell you, this is not a pleasant state to be in. So how can you maintain a \nhealthy level of self-confidence in who you are and what you can do? The answers, in part, lie \nin the Bhagavad Gita (Gita).  \nThe Gita, arguably one of the most revered texts in all the Vedic literature, is a vast storehouse \nof Yogic knowledge and philosophy. A part of the epic poem, The Mahabharata , it \nencapsulates the essence of Vedanta in the tale of Arjuna, the finest of warriors who is caught \nup in an epic battle between the forces of good and evil. Gathered on the battlefield of \nKurukshetra, the forces of good (Pandavas) and the forces of evil (Kauravas) are preparing for \nwar. The mighty Pandu warrior, Arjuna, asks his divine charioteer, Krishna, to place his \nchariot between the two armies so he can see who he has to fight. To his dismay, Arjuna sees \nin both armies friends, family, teachers, and respected elders, all willing to fight and die. \nOvercome with sorrow, Arjuna sinks into despair at the thought of the inevitable bloodshed. \nThe resulting dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna expounds on the path of yoga as a means \nof liberation from suffering. \nIn the second chapter of the Gita, The Yoga of Knowledge , Krishna instructs Arjuna in the \nways of yoga, essentially giving him a wakeup call from his despondency and sadness, saying: \nThis despair and weakness in a time of crisis are mean and unworthy of you, Arjuna. How \nhave you fallen into a state so far from the path to liberation? It does not become you to yield \nto this weakness. Arise with a brave heart and destroy the enemy. (C2, v2-3) \nThe lessons that follow are powerful spiritual tools for restoring Arjuna\u2019s self-confidence. Like \nArjuna, you can benefit from these timeless teachings in your quest for self-confidence and \nself-determination. As you read each of these five principles, allow the spiritual wisdom of \nthese teachings to resonate within you and feel your confidence grow as a result. \n5. Knowledge of   Self Being: \nIn Krishna\u2019s first teaching to Arjuna, he explains that the material world you perceive with \nyour five senses is not true reality. It is an illusion, albeit a convincing one. Your ultimate \nessence is pure spirit, pure timeless awareness. It is independent of the good or bad opinion of \nothers, feels above no one and beneath no one, and is fearless of all challenges.

Krishna \nreminds Arjuna: \nThe impermanent has no reality; reality lies in the eternal. Those who have seen the boundary \nbetween these two have attained the end of all knowledge. Realize that which pervades the \nuniverse is indestructible; no power can affect this unchanging, imperishable reality. The body \nis mortal, but he who dwells in the body is immortal and immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, \nfight in this battle. (Ch 2/16-18) \nWhen you truly embody this principle, it becomes impossible to harbor doubt, insecurity, or \nfear. In living from the level of your soul, your thoughts, speech, and actions embody the \nessence of pure unbounded spirit\u2014fearless, sure of itself, and courageous in all things. \n6. Purpose of Human Life \nKrishna then goes on to remind Arjuna to follow his dharma, or his purpose in life. Arjuna\u2019s \ndharma is that of a warrior, both literally and metaphorically. Arjuna has been a mighty warrior \nall his life; it is what he was born to do. But Krishna also encourages him to be a warrior for \nrighteousness and the pursuit of knowledge. This knowledge is the understanding of the \nnegative forces that grip the mind and rob you of your sense of purpose in the world. \nWhenever you lose your sense of purpose, you feel lost, adrift in a world that wouldn\u2019t care if \nyou existed or not. But Krishna reminds Arjuna that performing his dharmic duty is the key to \nsalvation: \nConsidering your dharma, you should not vacillate. For a warrior, nothing is higher than a \nwar against evil. The warrior confronted with such a war should be pleased, Arjuna, for it \ncomes as an open gate to heaven. But if you do not participate in this battle against evil, you \nwill incur sin, violating your dharma and your honor.  (Ch 2/31-33) \nWhile this passage may sound as if Krishna is advocating violence, the battle described is \nactually an internal one in which you are called upon to seek out the causes of your own \nignorance. When you pursue and fulfill your dharma or purpose in life, you feel driven, \ndeliberate, and purposeful in what you do. An important, valid, and unique piece of a universe \nthat has no spare parts, you can be confident knowing that what you do in the world matters \nand makes a difference. \n7. Taking True Action: \nWhat comes next is a hint at what will be discussed at length in future chapters of the Gita. \nKrishna reminds Arjuna that he is in this world to take action. Self-doubt, worry, and anxiety \nare the results not of action, but of mental turbulence, compulsive over-thinking, and analysis \nparalysis. When you fail to act, and get caught up in the endless \u201cwhat if\u201d loop, nothing is \naccomplished, and you doubt yourself more. If you act, however, you will either accomplish \nyour goals and find fulfillment, or fail, but learn from the experience. This lesson teaches you \nto not just sit on the sidelines of life and wonder, but to take selfless action and own the \nconsequences.

Your skills grow and you become \nmore capable. You develop the know-how and understanding to navigate your activities with \nskill and ease. This is a fundamental principle to building self-confidence\u2014regular, dedicated \npractice. As Krishna says: \nArjuna, now listen to the principles of yoga. By practicing these, you can break through the \nbonds of karma. On this path, effort never goes to waste, and there is no failure.

If you want to \nget better, and therefore more confident, keep practicing! \n9. Meditation- \nFinally, Krishna teaches Arjuna the profound knowledge for tapping into the spiritual wisdom of \nyoga: meditation. Through the practice of meditation, the voices of doubt, indecision, fear, and \nworry soften to distant whispers, ultimately fading away entirely. In addition, meditation allows \nyou to have direct experience of your soul\u2014the infinite, immortal, unbounded, pure spirit. \nStepping into this field sets you free from the need to seek the approval of others. Krishna \ndescribes those established in this wisdom: \nNeither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live free from lust and fear and anger. \nEstablished in meditation, they are truly wise. Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are \nneither elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. Such are the seers. (Ch 2/56-57) \nWhen we make regular contact with our true self, the soul\u2014the field of infinite consciousness\u2014\nwe experience self-confidence as our ground state. From this state of self-referral, we can know \nintuitively that we can accomplish anything. \n GIS SCIENCE JOURNAL\nVOLUME 8, ISSUE 3, 2021ISSN NO : 1869-9391\nPAGE NO: 1710", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2882, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11a0f0ef-f915-45cf-aa73-635667fad04f": {"__data__": {"id_": "11a0f0ef-f915-45cf-aa73-635667fad04f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "GitaGyan.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/meghasoni/Documents/Radboud - Specialization in Data Science/AskGita-Project/Data/GitaGyan.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 539036, "creation_date": "2024-02-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0c1b3cc-bef9-4753-8442-e8850cc4fadb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "GitaGyan.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/meghasoni/Documents/Radboud - Specialization in Data Science/AskGita-Project/Data/GitaGyan.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 539036, "creation_date": "2024-02-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "91714e28471062b52c44e6929d662844f13d9621cba851a4662df46c8f6b2d5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e007316d-79ba-49c6-8538-956c9209432d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "GitaGyan.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/meghasoni/Documents/Radboud - Specialization in Data Science/AskGita-Project/Data/GitaGyan.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 539036, "creation_date": "2024-02-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "16d8dfc5605b78b97a866a55bdc66772bffcd7342cfca7e58ba9f7ce5fc3ad65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "28d902ee-2ba1-4499-9e74-4a6bcc96a7ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eaed00e225a0199d8ed7759880944f2584451c674b71cc5abff819b1eb2b8409", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Some life changing Words in Bhagavad Gita:  \n \n We came to this world empty handed. We have made everything over here, be it relations, \nmoney, love or respect. We cannot take anything with us when we die. Everything would be left \nover here. World is perishable and whoever comes to this world surely has to go one day. Soul \ncan never be destroyed. Always remember you are a soul not a body. Death is just the passing of \nthe soul from the material world to the spirit realm. A truth can never be destroyed. One should \nnot be afraid of doing well. Whatever happened was good, whatever is happening is good and \nwhat all will happen in the future will be good. Work is of utmost importance and one must work \nwith dedication without always worrying about results. It talks a lot about meditation. Meditation \nis considered extremely helpful for inner peace and 'sadhna'. Things may not be the same, the \nway they used to be. Things and circumstances change. We should neither expect people, nor \nsurroundings, not even society to be same. They all change with time. Desires come and go, but \nyou should remain a dispassionate witness, simply watching and enjoying the show. Desires \nshould not bother a person. It tells us that God is always with us and around us no matter what \nwe are doing. A Bad feeling towards other living beings is the cause of man's inner destruction. \nIt must be avoided. Our Desires are the reason of our Sorrow. Good work never wasted, always \nrewarded by the God. If you want to be Great, Think great and Positive. Self control is the \nMantra of Success. Live a well balanced life, it will bring peace. Detachment from material \nthings is the way to inner peace. Don\u2019t proud of what you have, you can\u2019t bring your belongings \nwith coffin. \n Always speak if you are right and don\u2019t blame others. World always follows the acts of a great \nman. The way of Mukti is do good things and shine, else you need to rebirth. God loves them \nwho love humanity and not an arrogant. External or Material luxury gives you joy for a short \ntime. Keep Calm! Negative thoughts can divert your mind. Live your life the way you want, \ndon\u2019t be a slave for other\u2019s wish. Everything Belongs to God. Soul is Immortal, only body is \nmortal. If you want inner peace don\u2019t expect anything. If you tired from life \u2013 your will is your \npower. Nothing is perfect but we must do our Karma. We should always be calm, lovely and \ndevoted. \n \nConclusion: \n Shrimad Bhagavad Gita  always leads the human life to a happy and progressive way. Not only \nin India, many people of the world follow the sayings of lord Krishna rendered in Gita and \nachieve spirituality, calmness of mind and soul. So keep faith in God and in yourself and live \nyour life in the best way. We find that the ultimate goal of the human life is Self-realization and \nthe body, sense organs, mind are mere instruments to worship the divine. Gita says, the person \nwhose mind is always free from attachment, who has subdued the mind and senses, and who is \nfree from desires, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from Karma through renunciation. \nJust as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, just as the embryo rests deep \nwithin the womb, wisdom is hidden by selfish desire. Identifying ourselves not with the body, \nbut the soul at once changes everything. Soul is all pervading, it is eternal and it is God himself. \nWe have an eternal fountain of wisdom, knowledge and bliss within us as soon as we get rid of \nour body/mind identification. That is enlightenment. That is Self-Realization.
